# discord-pretty-help
An embed version of the built in help command for discord.py

Based on the DefaultHelpCommand that discord.py uses, but revised for embeds and cogs on individual pages that can be "scrolled" through with reactions.

It's not clean, just something I've been meaning to do for a while and finally had an afternoon to look into it.
